        <h1>Social Distancing</h1>

        <p>
            Visualize how social distancing helps <em>flatten the curve</em> and slows down the
            spread of a fictional disease in a community of little colored dots.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tweak the sliders below to change the parameters of the simulation. Some parameters may
            be changed as the simulation runs.
        </p>

        <p>
            Make some dots stop moving by adjusting the <em>Distancing</em> ratio. Self-isolating
            dots can still contract the disease from other moving dots, but since they're not
            moving, their transmission rate is greatly reduced.

            <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/"
                >Washington Post story</a
            >
            about social distancing. Please keep in mind that the simulation is simplified, and does
            not reflect how diseases spread in real life, not how people move in their communities.
            It's meant as an illustration of a principle, rather than a predictor of an exact
            outcome.
